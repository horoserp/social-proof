## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I continue to expand on my experience with mobile responsiveness. I chose to do this challenge using CSS Grid in combination with Flexbox, which reinforced my knowledge of CSS Grids.

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
  width: 77.08vw;
  height: 68.75vh;
  gap: 45px 30px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to explore ways to change the color of .svg files.

### Useful resources
